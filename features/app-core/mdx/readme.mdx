# Universal Expo + Next.js App Router Starter, with MDX

A minimal starter for a **universal Expo + Next.js app** with their respective app routers.

It's a good starting point if you want to:

- ✅ make use of _app-dir file based routing_ in expo and next.js
- ✅ have a _minimal monorepo setup_ with Typescript but no monorepo tool yet
- ✅ leave *all other tech choices* for e.g. styling, dbs, component libs, etc. *up to you*
