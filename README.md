## The [FullProduct.dev](https://fullproduct.dev?v=gh-demo-readme) 🚀 Starterkit

![It's a lot harder and costly to add a mobile app later than it is to start universally](https://fullproduct.dev/blog-assets/imgs/start-universally.jpg)

- **Universal from the Start 🙌 + Write-once UI:**
  - Build for web, iOS, and Android with a single codebase.
  - No more writing features twice / 3x - 90%+ of your UI and logic = shared across platforms.
  - Use React Native primitives (`View`, `Text`, `Image`) + NativeWind for max portability while still styling your universal UI with Tailwind.

![Write once + Universal UI](https://fullproduct.dev/blog-assets/imgs/write-once-universal-ui.jpg)

- **The GREEN Stack ✅ for an *Evergreen* project setup:**
  - **G**raphQL, **R**eact-Native, **E**xpo, **N**ext.js.
  - Designed to be powerful, future-proof, flexible, and easy to evolve as your project grows.

![Code colocation comparison, a vertical versus a horizontal split](https://fullproduct.dev/blog-assets/imgs/horizontal-vs-vertical-split.jpg)

- **Copy-Pasteable 📂 - Monorepo Architecture:**
  - Turborepo config already set up for you.
  - Features are organized by domain, not by front-end/back-end split. This makes it easy to copy, reuse, and scale features between projects.
  - Each feature workspace is self-contained: UI, API, models, schemas, utils, and more... All co-located in portable workspace packages.

<summary>What does that look like?</summary>

---

![Example Workspace Architecture](https://fullproduct.dev/blog-assets/imgs/colocate-by-feature-workspaces.jpg)

The idea is that each feature is a self-contained workspace, that defines its own UI, APIs, schemas, models, etc. and have automation scripts re-export them to the right places.

![](https://fullproduct.dev/blog-assets/imgs/feature-routes-to-universal-links.jpg)

This allows you to copy-paste features between projects, without the need for manual linking like you'd usually have to do without this architecture.

![Matt Pocock - The right abstraction, found at the right time, can save you weeks of work. It's often worth putting the time in](https://fullproduct.dev/blog-assets/imgs/matt-pocock-right-abstractions.jpg)

- **Single Sources of Truth 💎 - The Right Abstractions**
  - Define your data shape once using Zod schemas, and derive or (auto-)generate types, validation, docs, db models, and more from them.
  - Avoid bugs and wasted time by keeping your types, validation, and docs in sync automatically.

![Universal Data Fetching](https://fullproduct.dev/blog-assets/imgs/universal-data-fetching.jpg)

- **Universal Data Fetching 🔀 - For Expo and Next.js**
  - GraphQL + React Query for type-safe, cross-platform data fetching.
  - Fetch data the same way on server, browser, and mobile.

![Generators vs AI Codegen](https://fullproduct.dev/blog-assets/imgs/generators-vs-ai.jpg)

- **Modern DX & Codegen ⚙️ - Beyond just the Setup**
  - Built-in code generators for schemas, resolvers, forms, and more.
  - Fast monorepo setup with Turborepo (or use standalone if you prefer).

[![Rich Interactive docs example](https://fullproduct.dev/blog-assets/imgs/nextra-url-docs-example.jpg)](https://fullproduct.dev/docs/@app-core/components/Button?showCode=true)

- **Rich Interactive Docs 📚 - Automatically grow with your project**
  - Full documentation at [fullproduct.dev/docs](https://fullproduct.dev/docs?v=gh-demo-readme)
  - Best practices and guides included in the built-in docs
  - Automatic UI, API and Types docs generation from Zod schemas [(e.g.)](https://fullproduct.dev/docs/@app-core/components/Button?showCode=true)
  - Easy Onboardings / Handovers, *Great Context for LLMs*

![Combining Next.ts and Expo-Router app routers](https://fullproduct.dev/blog-assets/imgs/combining-app-routers.jpg)

The goal of any tech stack should be to stay **'Evergreen'**

- ✅ **GraphQL** - Universal, type-safe data fetching
- ✅ **React-Native** - Write-once UI that feels native
- ✅ **Expo** - Cross-platform app dev (Web / iOS / Android)
- ✅ **EAS** - Effortless builds and deploys to App Stores
- ✅ **Next.js** - Web-vitals and best-in-class SSR / SEO optimization

These are proven and widely supported technologies.

> Paired with TypeScript, Zod, and Tailwind (via Nativewind), this stack is designed to be robust, flexible, and here to stay. While still allowing you the freedom to choose your own Database and other core stack choices.

- **What is FullProduct.dev?**
  - A universal app starterkit to help you launch cross-platform apps faster, with best-in-class DX and monorepo architecture set up and designed for copy-paste.
- **Why use this over other starters?**
  - Most starters are either too opinionated or too barebones. This kit gives you a solid, flexible foundation and is designed for maximum code reuse across platforms, *and projects*.
- **I'm just starting out, should I use it?**
  - If you know the basics of JS & React, this kit will teach you how to build universal apps that can be used in a browser / found in Google, but also be installable from the iOS / Android App Stores.
  - Learning and knowing `react-native` and `expo` leads to a great skill potential employers *will* appreciate.
  - Built-in markdown docs will help both you and AI coding assistants better understand your project and way of working.
- **I'm an experienced engineer, why should I use it?**
  - Seniors like us know the right abstractions can save weeks / months of time. Start with a bunch of them already set up for you.
  - Eases onboardings and handovers thanks to built-in docs that automatically grow as you build.
  - Spend less time on boilerplate thanks to our generators and automation scripts.
  - Architecture is designed for copy-paste, maximum reusability, across platforms, *and projects*.
- **How do I convince my boss to use this?**
  - Show your non-technical lead the [FullProduct.dev](https://fullproduct.dev?v=gh-demo-readme) website.
  - Direct your technical lead to the [docs](https://fullproduct.dev/docs?v=gh-demo-readme), specifically the [core-concepts](https://fullproduct.dev/docs/core-concepts?v=gh-demo-readme).
  - Highlight the benefits of write-once universal apps: Bigger market share. More platforms = More trust = Higher margins. Maximum shareability with Universal Deeplinks > More viral potential.
  - Emphasize flexibility to pick + choose your own stack while still having a solid foundation. (Mergeable ready-made `git` based plugins & PRs soon)
- **How is it licensed?**
  - See `LICENSE.md` and the [eula](https://fullproduct.dev/eula?v=gh-demo-readme-license) for the details.
  - Base / demo version is open source, but not full-on open contribution.
  - Premium version and plugins are coming soon for [commercial licensing](https://fullproduct.dev/eula?v=gh-demo-readme-license).

## Built with 💚 - by 🟢 [Thorr ⚡️ @codinsonn.dev](https://codinsonn.dev)

![Timeline comparison to when I started experimenting with these universal app concepts vs. the releases Expo did, and the Web-Only boilerplate that have skyrocketed](https://fullproduct.dev/blog-assets/imgs/cross-platform-experimentation.jpg)

This stack and kit are the result of years of experimentation building both web and mobile apps in startups, agencies, and as a freelancer + solopreneur.

It's a collection of best practices, patterns and tools I had or wish I has during [my career](https://codinsonn.dev/resume?v=gh-demo-readme). Now, I hope to share it with you so you can build your own universal apps faster, with less manual boilerplate, and more reusable than ever before.
